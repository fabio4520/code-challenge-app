# Welcome to Code Challenge App!
This app attempts to be a small version of apps of code challenge like Leetcode or hackerrank.

The app at this moment only supports 1 problem but in the future the idea is to connect with a storage and process multiples files.

The app only supports one endpoint, --POST '/code/runtests'

backend file is in the following repository:
